I'm creating an eCommerce application where customers can browse products on a
wesbite or mobile app and order products. The above application is being developed as a Spring boot application in the VSCode IDE on a Mac.

The eCommerce application will be implementd in Java and consists of the following key files:
Product.java - contains the Product class, that lists a bunch of products that can be viewed by the customers
Customer.java - contains the Customer class,a list of customers who can view and order products
Orders.java - contains the Orders class,which represents the orders placed by the customers for specific products
States.json - The master data associated with the list of all valid states and their codes are contained here.
ecommerce.sql - file will contain the sql script to create the database schema and populate it with some sample values, We will use a postgres database as the persistence store for the application

The Product class has a controller ProductController.java which automatically lists all the products on the browser.
Would like to iterate through each product and create a list showing up in a Products.html webpage.
How can I do this?
